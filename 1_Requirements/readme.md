## INTRODUCTION & RESEARCH
Three-fourths of the earth is water, out of which 97 per cent is saline in oceans, seas and groundwater. The remaining 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent is fresh water, out of which 1.75 per cent to two per cent is frozen in glaciers, ice and snow. Fresh groundwater and soil moisture constitutes only 0.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent. Less than 0.01 per cent, available as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers, is available to us as drinking water. It is therefore imperative that systems are in place for managing this precious and scarce resource. The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.

## REQUIREMENTS

## High Level Requirements
1)Atmega 328:
The ATMEGA328 is a popular microcontroller due to it being a major component in the Arduino board products. The ATMEGA328 is the 8-bit RISC heart of the Arduino Uno and Nano, with a maximum clock frequency of 20MHz, 32KB program FLASH, and 2KB of RAM.

2)Conductive Sensor:
The sensor has a pair of electrodes, and applies alternating current to them. When the liquid covers the electrodes, it forms a part of an electric circuit, causing current to flow. The sensor measures electric resistance of the liquid, and compares the measured value with a preset value to determine liquid presence.

3)Seven Segment Display:
A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays.

## Low Level Requirements

1)  Availability of water in the tank.
2)  Unintrupted power supply.
3)  Embedded C Programming.
4)  SimulIDE.

## FEATURES
1)  Easy Installation.
2)  Low Maintenance.
3)  Compact and elegant Design.
4)  Consume very little energy, ideal for continuous operation.

## SWOT Analysis

Strength: Shows clear indication of water levels and Fully automatic.

Weakness: The rust, foul and deteriorate.

Opportunities: Automatic Water level Controller can be used in Hotels, Factories, Homes Apartments, Commercial Complexes, Drainage, etc., It can be fixed for single phase motor, Single Phase Submersibles, Three Phase motors and open well, Bore well and Sump.

Threats: Chances of sensor getting corroded when it is subjected in the salt water.

## 4W & 1H
WHEN:
It can be used for the water level measurement in the water tanks using the conductive sensor which can kept under the water.

WHO:
Every person who want to calculate the water level measurement by automation by using the conductive sensor can use this.

WHAT:
For calculating water level measurements in water tanks by using conductive sensor by which we can know the measurement of the water in the water tanks.

WHERE:
It can be used in water tanks, water in lakes, swaps, and rivers.

HOW:
By using the conductive sensor we can use to measure water level in water tanks.
